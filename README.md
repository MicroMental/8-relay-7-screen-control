# 8-relay-7-screen-control

This is a work in progress!!

This is for a raspberry pi running rasbian
With the tkinter and python files

What it dose is runs a program on the pi
That lets you control upto 8 GPIO pins 
from a touch screen attached to the pi 

The coding isn't the best as this is all very 
New to me 

If there's any way to add improvements 
please let me know

Il be working on some improvements once I figure out
How to add image files etc...
